        <h2>Is Audio Description available?</h2>
        <p>Yes, Disney provides Audio Description devices for rental. 
            Rentals can be purchased and picked up at Guest Relations.
            Rentals cost a refundable fee of $25. It is recommended to go to the parks early to rent these devices since rentals are on a first come first serve 
            basis and reservations are not available. Please bring your own headphones to use as well. </p>
            <p>To see what types are attractions and shows work with the device please view this link: <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/#/audio-description/sort=location/">Link</a></li></p>

        <h4>Are service dogs allowed?</h4>
        <p>Service dogs are allowed in all parks. Service animals must be trained and can be a dog or miniature horse.
            Some rides allowed service animals to ride with the owner, 
            while others may ask for the animal to wait at the load/unload area in a crate.
            There are multiple locations for service animals to relieve themselves as well.

        <h5>Are there scale models for me to feel?</h5>
        <p>At this time, only Tokyo Disneyland provides scale models of ride vehicles, buildings, and characters.
            Hopefully in the future, Walt Disney World will include this service.
