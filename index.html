		<h1>Accesibility at Walt Disney World</h1>
	</header>

	<main id="main">
		<p>Throught the years, Walt Disney World has been increasing it's offerings for 
            accessibility in their parks. From mobility to visual impariments, Disney is 
            constantly adjusting their services to better assist guests. Because Disney updates their
            services often, it can be confusing to identify what assistance may be available to you.
            This beta website aims to collect information on these services to help make trips to the 
            theme parks less stressful and accesible to more guests. </p>

        <h2>About Me: Emmy Thompson</h2>

        <p>I am a current UX research/design graduate student at the University of Michigan. 
        I obtained my B.S. in Psychology at Florida State University in 2020. My focus area is in
        creating digital tools that focus on universal design. In 2018, I worked at Walt Disney World 
        in the Disney College Program and this summer I will be interning at the Disney Animation 
        Studios working on product design. Disney has always been a personal passion for me, and 
        I hope to be able to spread it's magic with others. </p>
